# Graph Neural Networks: Homework 2

This repository contains Homework 2 of the course Graph Neural Networks (2025 Fall) at Peking University. Have fun!

## Content
- `assignment1.ipynb`: Transductive graph classification with iterative classification.
- `assignment2.ipynb`: Graph clustering with modularity maximization.
- `assignment3.ipynb`: Greedy algorithm for influence maximization using Linear Threshold model.
- `assignment4.md`: Prove the submodularity of the influence spread.

## Environment
- python >= 3.8
- numpy
- torch
- torch_geometric
- networkx
- matplotlib

Your local CPU should be sufficient to run the code.

## Guidelines
- Finish the `TODO` items in the notebook and run all cells.
- Feel free to modify the code and add new cells for your own experiments. Note that completing the code in the `TODO` items is already sufficient for high marks.
- Discussions and conclusions can be optionally written in the last markdown cell.

## Submission
- Zip the folder `gnn_hw2`, rename it to `name_stuID.zip`, and submit it to the [online platform](https://course.pku.edu.cn/).
