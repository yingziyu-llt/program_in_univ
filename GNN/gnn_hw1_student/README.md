# Graph Neural Networks: Homework 1

This repository contains the homework 1 of the course Graph Neural Networks (2025 Fall) at Peking University. Have fun!

## Content
- `assignment1.ipynb`: This assignment will guide you through the basic components and properties of graphs (Chapter 1: Introduction).
- `assignment2.ipynb`: This assignment will guide you to implement hand-crafted features for node- and link-level tasks on graphs (Chapter 2: Traditional Graph Representation Learning).
- `assignment3.ipynb`: This assignment will guide you to implement hand-crafted features for graph-level classification (Chapter 2: Traditional Graph Representation Learning).

## Environment
- python >= 3.8
- torch
- torch_geometric
- networkx
- matplotlib

Your local CPU should be sufficient to run the code.

## Guidelines
- Finish the `TODO` items in the notebook and run all cells.
- The goal is to play with the code and understand the concepts. Exploring the best hand-crafted features is encouraged, but not required.
- Feel free to modify the code and add new cells for your own experiments. Note that completing the code in the `TODO` items is already sufficient for high marks.
- Feel free to call established library functions or implement your own.
- Discussions and conclusions can be optionally written in the last markdown cell.

## Submission
- Zip the folder `gnn_hw1` and submit it to the [online platform](https://course.pku.edu.cn/).
