# Graph Neural Networks: Homework 3
This readme introduces the homework 3 of the course Graph Neural Networks (2025 Fall) at Peking University. Have fun! 

## Introduction
Follow [Node2Vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0218-groverA.pdf) to implement the basics of node2vec.

### Task 1
- Alias sampling
- Biased random walk
- Node2vec model training

Bonus:
- Negative sampling
- Parallelization and efficient implementation

### Task 2
- Please load Cora dataset and train node2vec model on it.
- Sanity check: visualize the embeddings of the nodes in 2D space.
- Evaluate the embeddings by node classification task (you may refer to the previous homework).

Bonus:
- Tune the hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
- You may optionally hand in related analysis and discussions.

## Guidelines
In this homework, we do not provide any code templates so that you can freely design your code structure. However, please gather the key results (visualizations, performance metrics, etc.) in a jupyter notebook named `main.ipynb`.

## Submission
- Zip everything into `name_stuID.zip`, and submit it to the [online platform](https://course.pku.edu.cn/).
